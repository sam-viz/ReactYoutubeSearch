First project built using react in combination with ES6. 
It is a small project which main objective is to present a youtube like application.
I started the project based on Stephen Grid boilerplate.
The Youtube-API helper was also a courtesy of Stephen Grid.

To run the project, 2 main steps:
1. Install project dependencies using:
`npm install`
2. Compile Babel ES6 to ES5 syntax and deploy it to the localhost:
`npm start`

Then head to the following url in the browser: localhost:8080
